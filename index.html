    <h3>MassPort Container Carriers by Alliance FY 2014 - FY 2020</h3>
    <p>
      As container carriers have consolidated services through mergers, acquisitions, and alliance restructuring, the number of carrier customers hailing the Massachusets Port Authority have waxed and waned 
      over the past few years. The connectivity of a port often is derived from the port's distinct carriers and alliance groupings. Although alliances largely offer cost-savings for the carrier, they can provide
      some benefits to the the shipper. However, with fewer unique carriers and services limited to a select group of alliance pairings, customer choice is limited. This type of information is important to monitor 
      for economic development purposes such as marketing the services available to the region for prospective shippers or for supply chain managers seeking potential alternative routings from the congested NY/NJ
      gateway.
      
      The datasets used in the visualization below was derived from <a href='http://www.massport.com/massport/finance/financial-publications/comprehensive-annual-financial-report-cafr/'>MassPort Annual Financial Reports</a>
      and combined with other information relating to milestones in major global container carrier alliance formation. The data was shaped into a "wide" format to allow for use of a stacked bar chart. This dataset consists of continuous quarterly information, categorical information representing the alliance, and numerical quanitiative data for the carrier counts per alliance. 
      I utilized this chart type because it provides a clear view of the total number of unique carriers while also demonstrating the sizes and names of the alliance sub groupings with a color channel and interaction event. The user may
      inspect a sub element of each quarter to examine the number of carriers participating in that alliance.

    <h3>2020 Global Container Carrier Schedule Reliability</h3>
	  <p>
      The global maritime supply chain and stakeholders like beficial cargo owners, marine terminal operators, 3PL's, drayage and moter carriers, railroads, and intermodal equipment providers all require 
      reliable service from their ocean container partners. Reliable service entails regularly scheduled arrival, departure, berthing, loading, and unloading of the vessels deployed in a service by an individual 
      ocean carrier and alliance partners. A variety of factors and disruptions can decrease this performance metric. During the past year, according to Sea-Intelligence data collected since 2011, global carrier 
      reliability across 34 trade lanes, 60+ carriers, and the alliances, has hit a record new low of 44.6%. This is significant in that global schedule reliability has hit double digit year over year declines for 
      the fith consecutive month. 

      The dataset used in the visualization below may be found <a href='https://sea-intelligence.com/images/press_docs/20210129_-_Sea-Intelligence_GLP_Press_Release_Charts_-_January_2021.xlsx'>here</a>. The data 
      was reshaped into a csv. The data was plotted using a line because the this medium is an effective way to represent quantative values representing the decimal ratio from 0 to 1 for overall carrier performance one a 
      continuous montly frequency.
